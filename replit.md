# Overview

This is a high-performance Go logging library called `logx` that provides structured logging capabilities with multiple output formats and destinations. The library is designed to be a lightweight alternative to popular logging frameworks like logrus and zerolog, with a focus on performance and simplicity. It supports various log levels, multiple output writers, and includes features like log rotation through integration with lumberjack.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Core Logging Architecture
The system follows a traditional leveled logging pattern with structured output formatting. The main architectural decisions include:

- **Level-based logging**: Implements standard log levels (TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, PANIC, FATAL) for filtering and categorizing log messages
- **Multiple output writers**: Supports concurrent writing to multiple destinations (files, stdout, custom writers)
- **Structured logging**: Provides both simple string logging and structured field-based logging for better log parsing and analysis
- **Context integration**: Built-in support for Go's context package for request tracing and cancellation
- **Thread-safe operations**: Uses mutex locks to ensure safe concurrent logging from multiple goroutines

## Performance Optimizations
The library prioritizes performance through several design choices:

- **Minimal allocations**: Designed to reduce memory allocations during logging operations
- **Lazy formatting**: Log messages are only formatted if they meet the current log level threshold
- **Buffer pooling**: Likely implements object pooling for log message buffers to reduce garbage collection pressure

## Output Management
The logging system supports flexible output configuration:

- **File rotation**: Integrates with lumberjack for automatic log file rotation based on size, age, and retention policies
- **Multiple writers**: Can simultaneously write to multiple destinations (console, files, network endpoints)
- **Configurable formatting**: Supports different output formats for different use cases

# External Dependencies

## Core Dependencies
- **lumberjack (gopkg.in/natefinch/lumberjack.v2)**: Provides log file rotation capabilities including size-based rotation, automatic compression, and old log cleanup
- **Go standard library**: Relies on built-in packages for I/O operations, synchronization primitives, and runtime information

## Benchmark Dependencies
- **logrus (github.com/sirupsen/logrus)**: Used for performance comparisons and benchmarking against established logging libraries
- **zerolog (github.com/rs/zerolog)**: Another logging library used for performance benchmarking to validate the performance claims of logx

## Runtime Requirements
- **Go 1.20+**: Minimum Go version requirement for compatibility with modern Go features and performance improvements
- **Cross-platform support**: Designed to work across different operating systems supported by Go
